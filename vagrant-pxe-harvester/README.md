Harvester iPXE Boot Using Vagrant Libvirt
=========================================

Introduction
------------

Utilizing [Vagrant][vagrant], [KVM][kvm], and [Ansible][ansible] to create a
ready-to-play virtual Harvester environment for evaluation and testing
purposes. Two Vagrant VMs will be created by default, PXE server and a
single-node Harvester respectively.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   Ansible \>= 2.9.0. This environment was tested with Ansible 2.9.5.
-   Vagrant \>= 2.0.3.
-   vagrant-libvirt plugin \>= 0.0.43.
-   KVM (i.e. qemu-kvm), preferably the latest and greatest. This
    environment was tested with qemu-kvm 2.11.
-   Please confirm that your libvirtd service is active.
-   OVMF.fd may not exists on your local environment, you could
    boot with legacy(BIOS) mode or try to make it work.
-   Host with at least 16 CPU, 64GB RAM, and 500GB free disk space.

Quick Start
-----------

1.  Edit `settings.yml` to make sure the configuration satisfies your
    needs. The options are self-documented.
2.  Run `setup_harvester.sh`. This may take awhile (i.e. 30 minutes
    depending on configuration).
3.  If successful, run `vagrant status` to see the status of the Vagrant
    boxes.
4.  Point your browser to `https://<harvester_vip>` to
    access the Harvester UI. Just ignore the scary SSL warnings for now
    as it is using self-signed certificates for demo purposes.
    *NOTE*: by default `harvester_vip` is `192.168.0.131`. However, it is
    configureable in `settings.yml`.
